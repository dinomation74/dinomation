     <p class="text"> My name is Charles Henry Mitchell 3 I am a student at the workshop school and we are a project based learning school. At first I was really confused on what that would mean. But I found out that we would be having fun projects and things of the sort. So I decided to stay. I really loved this school and it got even better when we was shown the opprotunity to join a coding class. When we finally started this class I was so interested at everything she was saying about html and css and javascript and I had no clue what any of that meant. At the beginning I wanted nothing to do with code and then the coding by kids teacher made me so interested but I didn't know jack squat about code so I kinda gave up. So she came over to me and was like you need help and I said no but she persist which was a good thing becasue I accomplished something I never thought I could. 3 weeks later I joined a compition well she made us join a compition where we compete against othe coders. And I had my insecure momments where I thought my page was trash but I got over that luckily.And here I am now a coder I cant believe that I, me made a website from code it blows my mind to this day and it is all thanks to CODED BY KIDS so thank you so much for the opportunity and special thanks to my teacher Ms.Robinson.
